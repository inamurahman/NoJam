## Introduction

NoJam is a revolutionary Flutter-based mobile application developed as part of the .hack Hackathon. 
It is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion by encouraging eco-friendly transportation choices. 
Our mission is to gamify the process of reducing carbon footprints and traffic congestion while making a positive impact on the environment.

## Features

- **Eco-Friendly Scoring:** The app uses the device's GPS and motion sensors to detect if the user is walking, cycling, or using public transportation. Users earn points for eco-friendly modes of transportation.

- **Leaderboard:** Compete with friends and other users to see who can accumulate the most eco-friendly points and make the biggest impact on reducing carbon emissions and traffic.(Not implemented)

- **Rewards and Achievements:** Unlock achievements and redeem rewards as you reach specific milestones on your eco-friendly journey.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) should be installed on your development machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-footprint-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd carbon-footprint-app
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### User Registration

- Create a new account with your email or sign up using your Google or Facebook account.

### Location and Motion Permissions

- Allow the app to access your device's location and motion data. This enables us to accurately track your transportation choices and calculate your eco-friendly points.

## How It Works

The Carbon Footprint Reduction App uses a combination of location data and motion sensors to determine your mode of transportation. Here's how it works:

1. **Tracking Transportation**: The app continuously monitors your movement. If you're walking, cycling, or using public transportation, it will recognize these modes of travel.

2. **Eco-Friendly Scoring**: You earn points for eco-friendly modes of transportation. For example, taking the bus or walking earns more points than driving alone.

3. **Compete and Earn Rewards**: Challenge friends and other users on the leaderboard. As you accumulate points, you unlock achievements and redeem rewards that benefit you and the environment.

## Technologies Used

The Carbon Footprint Reduction App is built using cutting-edge technologies, including:

- **Flutter**: The app's frontend is developed using the Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Google Maps API**: For accurate location tracking and route recommendations.(Not implemented)
- **Motion Sensors**: To detect user movement and modes of transportation.
- **Firebase**: For user authentication, data storage, and leaderboards.(Not implemented)
